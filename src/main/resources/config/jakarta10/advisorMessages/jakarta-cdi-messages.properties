empty-beans-xml=******** \n \
  In CDI 4.0 and later, the presence an empty beans.xml file causes an archive to be treated as an implicit bean archive,\n \
  the equivalent of setting the bean-discovery-mode="annotated" attribute. \n \
  Only objects with CDI bean-defining annotations are CDI beans. \n \
  If necessary, you can set the cdiemptyBeansXmlCDI3Compatibility attribute to enable compatibility with previous versions. \n \
  Setting this attribute to true in CDI 4.0 causes an empty beans.xml file to be treated as an explicit beans archive.
